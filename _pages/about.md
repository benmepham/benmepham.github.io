### Linux / DevOps / Self Hosting

Experienced in: Ubuntu/Debian, Docker, CI/CD, Virtual Private Servers.

Since 2018 I've been running some form of Linux home server (more details in an upcoming blog post...) to host my files and media and run software such as home assistant. This has taught be a lot about maintaining reliable linux systems, virtualisation and self-hosting.

I've been running pop_os on my personal computer since January 2020. It has been a really useful learning experience, and has made software development much easier.
